### Development of driving cycle and estimation of associated emmissions

A Project under Associate Professor Dr. Abhishek Mudgal

*ðŸ“… Duration:*  Jan â€™23-May â€™23

*ðŸ”§ Description:*

-Advanced Programming for Data Analysis: Leveraged Python with Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and Glob to analyze real-world driving cycle data, calculating vital parameters such as average speed, acceleration, idling, and cruising.

-Micro-Trip Integration: Strategically derived micro-trips from speed-time profiles and seamlessly integrated them to construct a comprehensive driving cycle.

-Comparative Benchmarking: Benchmarked Varanasi's driving cycle against IDC and EUDC, uncovering a notable 5.11% speed increase from IDC and a stark 101.99% decrease from EUDC, directing pivotal vehicle performance optimizations.

-Emission Impact Analysis: Employed the city's developed driving cycle to assess crucial pollutants (CO, NOx, CO2), shedding light on the potential environmental ramifications within urban settings.

-Emission Data Generation: Through precision parameter matching and specialized modeling, derived emission data to understand the broader environmental impact of real-world driving cycles.

This endeavour seamlessly merged theoretical insights with practical application, exemplifying my commitment to pushing the boundaries of engineering knowledge.
