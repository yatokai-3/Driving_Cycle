## Development of driving cycle and estimation of associated emmissions

The main focus of this project is to generate emission data using the real-world
driving cycle. Driving Cycle uses the vehicular data moving from one location to another from different routes every time to experience different driving
patterns and gather data as random as possible.

### What is Driving Cycle.
A driving cycle is a predefined speed-time profile that represents typical driving patterns of a vehicle. It provides a standardized way to evaluate and compare vehicles' fuel efficiency and other performance characteristics under similar conditions.
